# Workout Planner Application 

---
## What will the app do?
The general idea of this application is to hopefully help people of different physique goals and experience to create 
their *ideal** workout routine. This application will have:
* Some pre-made exercises (a glossary of these exercises 
will be made, where a description of each exercise is presented)
* Some pre-made workouts (for example, a full-body workout, 3 day split workout [chest day + back day + leg day], 
stretches, endurance workout, strength workout, etc.)
* the functionality of adding a custom exercise not included with the pre-made exercises, adding a description for it.
* the ability to rate the workouts (perhaps different categories like difficulty, fat burn, does it require a lot of
equipment? )

>Disclaimer:
>*Although my ambition with this application is to give the person enough room to customize their routine, ultimately
the range of customization will be limited and due to this being worked on solely by myself, thus some may find it useful
while others may not. Nevertheless, this is something I thought would be fun to make.

## Who will use it?
The final application **could potentially be used by anyone** (assuming enough pre-made workout programs
are made), however, since the time is limited for this project, the design/features will be biased towards the average
male/woman (need to define this better later). 

However, technically speaking, it is **impossible** to create a program
that would be able to produce the 'ideal' workout routine for everyone, which is why, personally, I would recommend
anyone who wants to see the best results in the fastest time to get a personal trainer. 

That being said, with enough
background knowledge, I believe that one could definitely find this application useful in managing their workout
planning.

## Why is this project of interest to me?

In the summer, when I was 16, I went to the gym for the first time ever. I had little to no knowledge about any
exercises, I was overwhelmed. I learned my way through educating myself to YouTube channels like ATHLEAN-X, watching a
bunch of bodybuilder gym-vlogs, vids of powerlifting meets, and science based videos on nutrition. Gym was almost like a
passion of mine for 2 years. I haven't been to a gym since COVID-19 started :(, and I really miss the day when I hit 120
kg on a bench press at 75 kg bodyweight (according to https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/bench-press/kg, this
bench press implies that I achieved advanced mark at that point in time - which made me stronger than 80% of lifters).

>Either way, I decided to make this app because:
>1. I have some experience in this area; and
>2. It seems like a challenging project from which I can learn a lot because in terms of programming as 
well as facilitating my understanding of a good gym program (because, to be real, I will get back
on the gym grind eventually, and who knows, maybe this program could actually help me plan my workout).
